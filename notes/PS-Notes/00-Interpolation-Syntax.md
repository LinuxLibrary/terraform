# Interpolation Syntax - Terraform Manifest

- ***Available Variables***
	- User string variables
		- Use the var. prefix followed by the variable name. For example, ${var.foo} will interpolate the foo variable value.
	- User map variables
		- The syntax is var.MAP["KEY"]. For example, ${var.amis["us-east-1"]} would get the value of the us-east-1 key within the amis map variable.
	- User list variables
		- The syntax is "${var.LIST}". For example, "${var.subnets}" would get the value of the subnets list, as a list. You can also return list elements by index: ${var.subnets[idx]}.
	- Attributes of your own resource
		- The syntax is self.ATTRIBUTE. For example ${self.private_ip} will interpolate that resource's private IP address.
	- Attributes of other resources
		- The syntax is TYPE.NAME.ATTRIBUTE. For example, ${aws_instance.web.id} will interpolate the ID attribute from the aws_instance resource named web. If the resource has a count attribute set, you can access individual attributes with a zero-based index, such as ${aws_instance.web.0.id}. You can also use the splat syntax to get a list of all the attributes: ${aws_instance.web.*.id}.
	- Attributes of a data source
		- The syntax is data.TYPE.NAME.ATTRIBUTE. For example. ${data.aws_ami.ubuntu.id} will interpolate the id attribute from the aws_ami data source named ubuntu. If the data source has a count attribute set, you can access individual attributes with a zero-based index, such as ${data.aws_subnet.example.0.cidr_block}. You can also use the splat syntax to get a list of all the attributes: ${data.aws_subnet.example.*.cidr_block}.
	- Outputs from a module
		- The syntax is MODULE.NAME.OUTPUT. For example ${module.foo.bar} will interpolate the bar output from the foo module.
	- Count information
		- The syntax is count.FIELD. For example, ${count.index} will interpolate the current index in a multi-count resource. For more information on count, see the resource configuration page.
	- Path information
		- The syntax is path.TYPE. TYPE can be cwd, module, or root. cwd will interpolate the current working directory. module will interpolate the path to the current module. root will interpolate the path of the root module. In general, you probably want the path.module variable.
	- Terraform meta information
		- The syntax is terraform.FIELD. This variable type contains metadata about the currently executing Terraform run. FIELD can currently only be env to reference the currently active state environment.
